# Dartlang

Trying out the language, with particular reference to
- finding equivalents to preferred Java idioms
- implementing key Superficial concepts

## Trivial

Tries out Dart alternatives to 'trivial' Java hierarchy
ie where the implementation of an unchanging contract
is progressively refined.  

Special focus on finding equivalent 
of anonymous local classes as parameter objects, 
especially 'couplers' which supply both parameters 
and local functionality.
